## Homework format

The homework format specified at the begining of the homework assignment: "Write your solutions, answers and results etc. in complete sentences, clearly lay out your setup, background etc. in the main part, and append program codes in the back; all needs to be turned in."

The following is simple way you can do it without the need to specify names for code chunks.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Appendix: Code

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, ref.label=knitr::all_labels()}
```
